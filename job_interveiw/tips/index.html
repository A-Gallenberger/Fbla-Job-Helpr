     <ul>
         <li>Practice makes perfect so then you don't get thrown off by a hard question.</li>
         <li>Be confident; Maintain eye contact, shake hands firmly, but only if they offer you a hand, and be honest and give direct answers.</li>
         <li>End with a good impression; Be courtious and thank them for their time to meet with you today, find out when he/she will make the decision, if not soon let them contact you.</li>
         <li>What not to do; Be too aggresive, application and resume is sloopy or incomplete, lack of maturity, lack of interest and enthusasm, negetive outlook on other empolyers and employees.</li>
     </ul>
